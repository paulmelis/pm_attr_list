# pm_attr_list

This is a modified version of Python-Markdown's
attr_list extension, to allow list-wide attributes to
be set. The latter allows several useful things, for example

* Starting a numbered list at a specific number
* Setting a custom class on an `<ol>` or `<ul>` tag

All other functionality should match the included `attr_list`
extension.

## FAQ

* This would make a great addition to include in Python-Markdown's
attr_list extension itself!

Requests to add a feature to control list-wide attribute
have been made at the Python-Markdown project over many years ([227](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown/issues/227), 
[312](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown/issues/312),
[505](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown/issues/505),
[594](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown/issues/594),
[600[https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown/issues/600)
[668](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown/issues/668), [1251](https://github.com/Python-Markdown/markdown/pull/1252)),
but developer feedback has albeen been very negative. Hence this
extension.
